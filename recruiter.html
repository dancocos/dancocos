      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This is an actual email that I received and my response, some names have been removed solely because I'm a nice guy. Though I really need to add to my resume (don't worry co-workers I'm not looking for a job this is just a great source of entertainment for me) something about half assed recruiting attempts will be met with sarcasm.<br><br>Dear VT,<br><br>I am writing to let you know that you have contacted me via a Job Portal. In order for this to go further please follow the directions below for a face-to-face meeting after going through the following details.<br><br>1. Your unique employer information number 3241231 Please use this number in all future correspondence with me.<br><br>2. Your reporting time at the local coffee shop will be 6:30PM(LOCAL TIME) Please send me back a couple of other times if this won't work for you.<br><br>3. Please read my resume, this will catch you up on background information, and have a list of jobs that are appropriate for me.<br><br>4. To confirm that you want to move forward with this please send me an email with a picture of a kitten. This assures that this is not some automated non-sense or just a mass mailing to Monster users from a recruiter who simply searched on a key word and sent this to everyone that matched.<br><br>5. Please send me a list of the current salaries of the team that I will be working with, including W2s.<br><br>6. Please make sure you bring money for you own coffee as this will not be covered by me, $3 should be sufficient. If you don't bring money you'll have to pan handle for change to pay for it.<br><br>7. Please note that 90% of the time I work from my living room, if this causes a problem please highlight this.<br><br>8. Please look for an email that has the title JUMPING_THROUGH_HOOPS: 3241231 in next few days.<br><br>9. If anything about your company has changed recently please update your website then send the links with the changed pages.<br><br>10. If you would like to withdraw from this process at anytime please let me know by sending an email with a picture of a dog attached.<br><br>I look forward to hearing from you and wonder if you think what I'm asking you to do any more ridiculous than what you have sent me?<br><br>later,<br>dan<br><br>On Jan 29, 2007, at 8:17 AM, VT wrote:<br><br>Dear DC Dan,<br><br><br><br>We are writing to you with regard to the CV sourced by us from a Job Portal/ your application to us for employment.

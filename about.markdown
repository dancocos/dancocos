# I Help Tech Teams Thrive

I specialize in guiding organizations and their important work on complex technical issues. I have experience helping to improve process, creating and expanding devops, increasing reliability, insuring security, and regulatory compliance. 

I work at [BAO Systems](https://baosystems.com). I have over 20 years experience leading software development teams working with a large variety of clients from the private sector, the public sector to large and small NGOs.

I've specialized in DevOps, Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, and Linux, with an emphasis on AWS, GCP, and open source software.
